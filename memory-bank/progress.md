## Current Status

**Phase**: Production Ready ✓

All core components implemented and tested:
1. Project configuration files ✓
2. Core application code with 18 MCP tools ✓
3. Docker support with SSE transport ✓
4. Documentation ✓
5. Memory bank files ✓
6. Production testing with real Jira Cloud instance ✓

**Demonstrated Capabilities:**
- Created issue MIM-6859 programmatically
- Assigned users using accountId lookup
- Added AI-generated comments
- Fixed critical assignee bug for Jira Cloud

**Next**: Ready for production use, future enhancements as needed

## Known Issues

- MCP parameter serialization auto-parses JSON objects in strings (workaround: use direct API calls when needed)
- Custom fields require knowledge of field IDs (documented in additional_fields parameter)

## Blockers

- None

## Success Metrics
